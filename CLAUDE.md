# SlapMania — project context

A QWOP-style 3D slapping-contest game. You control a slapper's body with four
keys and try to launch a county-fair volunteer as far as possible. Absurd,
skill-based, built to be shared. (Renamed from "SLAPP!"; internal storage keys
and the `window.__slapp` debug handle still use the `slapp` prefix — **do not
rename them**, the Supabase table `slapp_scores` depends on it.)

Moved to its own repo (`~/slap-game`) on 2026-07-07, out of the old
`speech-practice` working dir.

## Run it

Static site, **no build step** — three.js 0.160 + cannon-es 0.20 via a CDN
import map. ES modules require HTTP (not `file://`):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8994 -d .    # then open http://localhost:8994
```

There's a `.claude/launch.json` entry named `slap-game` for the preview tooling.

## The core mechanic — the S/L/A/P kinetic chain

Pre-contact the slapper is **not** physics-engine driven: each joint is a scalar
angle integrated with key-held torques (in `player.js`). The four keys form a
**gated chain** tuned for human tempo, not twitch reflexes:

1. **S — coil.** Hold to twist the torso back (spine `k=16`, torque `+75`,
   caps ~1s to full coil). On release the body **holds** the coiled pose,
   leaking only `0.55 rad/s`, waiting for you.
2. **L — hips.** Fires the whip: a forward lunge + spine unlock. This is the
   trigger; the held coil is spent now. Firing L while still deeply coiled tips
   you over (a foul).
3. **A — arm.** Unlocks the shoulder; the torso's forward speed at this instant
   slings into the arm.
4. **P — palm.** Unlocks elbow+wrist and **opens the fist into a palm**. A
   closed palm never registers contact (the contact test in `opponent.js`
   requires `pUnlocked`) — so slow fingers whiff, they don't foul.

A fresh **S** after a spent/whiffed swing re-arms the whole chain
(`player.rearm()` + `resetChain()`) — every S is an independent attempt within
the 10s shot clock.

## Power & grading (see `main.js` `onContact` for exact code)

```
power = 12.5 × strength × balF × coilF × gradeL × gradeA × gradeP × sweetspot
power = min(power, 30 × strength)          // cap scales with muscle
```

- `strength` = the slapper's `power` stat. `balF = 1 − 0.45·min(1,|lean|/1.05)²`
  — a teetering stance delivers up to 45% less force (real slap physics), and a
  big lean also tilts the arc off the cheek, so off-balance slaps miss or become
  body blows. `sweetspot` = 1.35 head / 0.6 torso.
- **Deterministic**: mash ≈ 1m, careful-but-imperfect ≈ 15–21m, flawless ≈ 90m+.
  Launch jitter is tight (±4%) so flights are earned by technique, not dice.
- **Grading** (all speed-invariant so the HUD cues never lie):
  `gradeL` = crispness of L after the S release (PERFECT ≈ −0.10..0.35s);
  `gradeA` = spine forward velocity when A fires (≥6 rad/s = PERFECT);
  `gradeP` = spine **phase** when P fires (PERFECT window ≈140ms wide).
- Chain % shown to the player = `product / 1.8` (how close to theoretical max).

## Playable slappers (physique is real — `SLAPPERS` in `player.js`)

`height` scales the model **and the strike plane** (short slappers slap *upward*
→ steeper launch arcs → the longest flights on light volunteers). `arm` scales
reach + stance offset `baseX = 0.73·(1−h·arm)`. `power` multiplies force and the
cap (so muscle only pays off against heavy volunteers). Hand/palm color derives
from each slapper's skin (skin lerped 14% toward white) — **never hardcode it**.

| Slapper | ht / arm / pwr | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SLAPPIN' CHARLIE | 0.93 / 0.97 / 1.00 | short king — best flights on featherweights |
| FARMHAND FRAN | 1.00 / 1.06 / 0.92 | blonde pigtails, plaid dress, long reach |
| UNCLE BUCK | 0.98 / 0.95 / 1.06 | afro, deer tee |
| RODEO ROY | 1.08 / 1.08 / 1.20 | Black cowboy, heavyweight specialist (most power) |
| VICTOR SEPUP | 0.99 / 1.00 / 1.02 | the user's avatar (blue shirt; rejected title "architect" → "JUST VICTOR") |
| MADAM MEI | 0.90 / 0.93 / 0.88 | Asian woman, long hair/earrings/skirt/bust — sky-launcher |

## Volunteers (`ROSTER` in `opponent.js`)

`mass` drives knockback (`knockback = mass^0.75`) AND the score multiplier
(`pts = dist × mass × 10`), so heavy folk barely move but pay big. Perfect-chain
ceilings noted (with landing-zone solids in play).

| Volunteer | w / h / mass | Tag | ~ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| SLIM PETE | 0.6 / 1.08 / 0.4 | Featherweight | ~90–115m (skinny, flies like a dart) |
| HAYSEED HANK | 1.0 / 1.0 / 1.0 | Middleweight | ~95m, ~950 pts (the points king) |
| RAVIN' RAY | 1.35 / 0.98 / 1.8 | Heavyweight | striped tee, shades, no stache |
| MULE-KICK MABEL | 0.95 / 1.0 / 0.95 | Middleweight | sun hat |
| BIG HOSS | 1.75 / 1.1 / 2.6 | Super-heavy | ~26m — pure points pick |
| BIG BERTHA | 1.42 / 0.96 / 1.9 | Heavyweight | ~40m (moo + duel fire on her) |
| GRANDPA CLETUS | 0.9 / 0.93 / 0.75 | Veteran | white hair, suspenders |
| TREMENDOUS DON | 1.15 / 1.03 / 1.3 | Executive | suit/red tie/blonde swoop/orange skin, **long sleeves**, hatless. A **volunteer, not a playable slapper** — an original parody character |

Collar-shrug fix (`opponent.js checkHit`): torso contacts above
`torsoY + rTorso·0.5` are ignored so wide victims' collarbones don't silently
turn PERFECT chains into 0.6× body blows. A body blow now means genuinely low
contact only.

## World, containment & the reward ladder

**Open world, no fake walls.** The only hard physics edges are a forest
perimeter (dead catch, restitution 0.06) at `x=117 / x=−22 / z=±37`, dressed
with instanced conifers exactly on those lines — nobody ever hits invisible air.
Side rails only near the ring (`x −15..20`). Solid colliders (`stage.solids →
addSolids()` in `ragdoll.js`) back every visible structure (barn, silo, windmill,
tractor, trees, hay, farmhouses, outhouse, scarecrows, orchard trunks), so bodies
bounce off them instead of clipping through — which shortens the longest Slim
flights to ~92m.

**Reward ladder** (thresholds in `main.js`; recalibrated for open-world
distances). Milestones fire mid-flight; the **SLAPMASTER / SLAP EMPEROR
ceremonies fire at landing** (`showResult`), not mid-air, so the player sees
where the body lands first. The result card is deferred via `pendingCard` /
`cardDelay` (1.1s normal, 2.8s master, 4.0s emperor); `advance()` blocks while a
card is pending.

| Distance | Reward |
|---|---|
| 20m | Smash through the barricade |
| 30m | Cow moos, kids celebrate |
| 40m | Slap angel vs slap devil duel |
| **62m** | **SLAPMASTER** — cleared the hay wall; spirits smile from the sky |
| 80m | Crossed the COUNTY LINE |
| **85m + ≥90% chain** | **SLAP EMPEROR** — hand glows, slapper ascends into heaven |

Commentary tiers at >62m (corn), >80m (county line), >95m (left the county).
World content along the lane: in-lane cornfield (x64–96), apple orchard (NE),
orange grove (S), 4 parametric farmhouses (SLAPP ACRES at 96,19), pond (40,24),
county-line sign (80, 5.5), scarecrows, outhouse, clothesline, sunflowers, birds
(fly through the flock → `scareBirds` + feathers + `sfx.squawk`), distant hills.
Distance markers to 100m.

## Camera, touch, audio

- **Camera** stays with the flyer in FLIGHT (rises with high arcs, slides with
  drift). On the opponent-pick screen the slapper steps to `x=−2.6` so he isn't
  hugging the volunteer.
- **Touch controls** (`#touchPad`): left thumb S/L, right thumb A/P. Buttons
  dispatch synthetic `KeyboardEvent`s so all rules stay in one path. Shown via
  `syncTouchPad()` during play states only; `body.touch` raises the meters.
- **Audio** is fully synthesized in `audio.js` — no asset files.

## Debug & test harness — `window.__slapp`

This is how you test/tune without a human. **Prefer it over setTimeout-scripted
playtests**, which are unreliable under hidden-tab timer throttling.

- `.drive(events, seconds)` — steps the sim **synchronously at 60fps** with a
  scripted key timeline `[[ms, 'KeyS', true], ...]`. Returns `{log, peak,
  contactSpeed, state, attempts, dist, ...}`.
- `.freeze(on)` — pause/resume for freeze-frame screenshots.
- Getters: `state`, `pickIndex`, `attempts`, `keys`, `milestones`, `bestScore`,
  `chainState`; methods `player()`, `opponent()`, `dist()`, `animals()`.

**Testing gotchas (these have bitten every session):**
1. Key events during **FACEOFF** (~2.4s) are ignored — wait ~2.6s after
   confirming an opponent before scripting a swing.
2. `goToTitle` / `startAttempt` do **not** release held keys — every scripted
   swing must dispatch keyups or the next run inherits stuck `aUnlocked`/
   `pUnlocked`. When in doubt, `keyup` S/L/A/P before starting.
3. Pressing the digit of the **already-highlighted** pick card **confirms** it —
   for scripted navigation, walk with `ArrowRight` until `__slapp.pickIndex`
   matches, then `Enter`.
4. A real (isTrusted) keypress **auto-unfreezes** a frozen game — so if the user
   is playing live, your `freeze`/`drive` state can be interrupted.
5. Browser caches ES modules — after editing a `js/` file,
   `fetch(url,{cache:'no-cache'})` each edited file, **then** reload.

## Supabase leaderboard

`net.js` talks to Supabase PostgREST directly (no SDK). Credentials live in
`window.SLAPP_CONFIG` in `index.html` — **already filled in and live**. The anon
key is public by design; row-level security + CHECK caps protect the data.
Everything degrades gracefully to a **local-only** board when unconfigured
(the "POST MY SCORE" box and global panel simply hide).

- Table `slapp_scores` (`supabase.sql`): RLS allows select + insert only (no
  delete/update for anon). CHECK caps: `pts ≤ 2500`, `dist ≤ 130` — sized for
  open-world scores (a real featherweight flies ~110m) while still blocking
  forgeries. **If you change the distance/points ceilings, update these caps** or
  real scores get rejected.
- `net.configured()`, `net.fetchTop(n)`, `net.submit({name,pts,dist,opp})`.

## Conventions & state

- **localStorage keys**: `slapp_board` (top-5), `slapp_name`, `slapp_master`,
  `slapp_emperor`. Keep the `slapp` prefix.
- **Working alongside a live player**: the user often plays during dev sessions.
  Before scoring test runs, capture `localStorage.slapp_board` JSON, and restore
  the user's real entries + reload afterward. **Never wipe their achievements** —
  they earned SLAP EMPEROR legitimately.

## Launch state & remaining to-dos

**Done:** core game, open-world + recalibrated ladder, physique, balance→power,
deferred ceremonies, solid collisions, touch controls, OG image + favicon +
social meta, Supabase leaderboard wired and verified live (read + write + caps).

**Left for the user:**
- Delete the `SETUPTEST` test row from the Supabase Table Editor (leftover from
  the write-test; anon can't delete it).
- After choosing a domain, make the `og:image` / `twitter:image` URLs
  **absolute** in `index.html` (crawlers require it).
- Pick a static host (GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel) and deploy.

## Post-launch additions (2026-07-07 → 07-10) — supersedes stale bits above

- **Live at `https://slapmania.org`** (GitHub Pages, repo `victortanws/slapmania`,
  custom domain + HTTPS enforced; old github.io URL 301s). OG URLs are absolute.
  Analytics: Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon + PostHog (funnel events:
  slapper_selected, match_started, slap_landed, slapmaster/emperor_reached,
  match_completed, score_posted, share_clicked, challenge_opened/result).
- **Key labels renamed** to spell S·L·A·P: SWIVEL / LUNGE / ARM / PALM
  (mechanics unchanged; internal ids like `cl-coil` kept).
- **DLC roster** (`locked: true, price` in `SLAPPERS`): dynamite, bruceslee,
  chucknorth, earl, reverend, auntie. Gated by `DLC_LIVE` in main.js — a master
  kill switch that overrides `localStorage.slapp_unlocks`, the SLAPDEV dev code
  and `?unlockall=1`. **Keep false until Stripe checkout ships**, then flip.
  `?preview=<key>` showcases any slapper or volunteer (hides the card dock).
- **Volunteers**: ROSTER has 11 incl. THE INFLUENCER, but the public pick uses
  the `PICKABLE` export (9 — `boss: true` excluded). The two **bosses** are
  **campaign-only**, summoned by tour challenges via `chosenArch`: BOULDER BOB
  (mass 4.0, w 2.15 / h 1.28 — barely moves, pays ×4; stony skin, unibrow,
  handlebar stache, champion's belt) and DODGY DALE (`weave: true` — a
  fixed-rhythm boxer's slip in `Opponent.update`, 1.5s pocket / 1.5s
  ducked-and-back that beats even the rebound flail; frizzy gray hair).
  `?preview=<bossKey>` still showcases bosses directly.
- **Reach fairness**: `strikeLift` upper clamp is 0.9 (was 0.5) so the shortest
  slappers can cheek the tallest volunteers; launch arc unaffected (dir.y
  saturates at lift 0.33). Verified via sim matrix.
- **Weekly leaderboards + matchup boards + challenge links**: `net.js` has
  `weekKey()/supportsSeasons()/fetchChampion()/fetchMatchup()`; falls back to
  legacy all-time board until `supabase_migrate_weekly.sql` is run (adds `week`,
  `slapper` columns). Challenge URL params: `?cpts=&copp=<oppKey>&csl=<slKey>&cby=`
  → banner + preselects + verdict on the match card; the share button emits one.
- **County board** is lost-update-safe (read-modify-write + `storage` sync) and
  reclaims worldwide posts under the saved name via `net.fetchByName`.
- **Campaigns** in `js/campaign.js` (`TOURS`): two storylines × 3 acts × 3
  challenges — "The Legend of the Open Palm" (ids a1c1..a3c3; Bob + Dale as
  capstones) and "Save the Fair" (ids f1c1..f3c3; the four exam bosses below).
  Goals judged per attempt from existing numbers (dist/pts/head/chain%),
  tier-calibrated (Act I casual / II good / III expert), progress in
  `localStorage.slapp_tour` (read once at module load — reload after editing
  it in tests), acts unlock sequentially per tour. **Hidden from the public**:
  `CAMPAIGN_LIVE = false`; reachable only via `?tour=1`. Test hooks:
  `__slapp.tour`, `__slapp.tourReset()`.
- **Boss mechanics** (arch flags, composable): `shotClock` (THE JUDGE, 5s),
  `grease` (GREASED PETE — non-PERFECT palm ⇒ power ×0.45, "IT SLID OFF!"),
  `chainGate` (IRON-JAW McGRAW 70 / GRANNY THUNDER 60 — below the posted
  chain% ⇒ power ×0.12, "NO-SOLD!"), `weave` (Dale, Granny). Feedback bursts
  go through `ui.slapBurst` (the **banner**, not `#smack` — don't confuse them
  when testing). New look flags: `ironJaw` (steel chin), `brow`, `frizz` hair.
